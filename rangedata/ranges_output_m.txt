Plus his low register is used frequently in even the heavier sections which is quite rare. He has potential for solid range as both ends are hardly strained but It seems unlikely to find anything extreme.

Bolton can be described as a a baritenor, for he can sing tenor very naturally - sometimes without barely any effort - with a deep, husky baritone vocal sound.

I don't only love the classic Kick, I'm also a fan of the underrated Welcome to Wherever You Are.The late Michael Hutchence, known as the legendary frontman of one of Australia's biggest rock acts (INXS), was a big target for the tabloids for his personal life outside the band, but his legacy still revolves around his music, voice, looks and performing skills. A very charismatic persona, Hutchence was a natural at controlling huge crowds within the palms of his hands. His stage show was always alluring yet emotional, and he remained an amazing artist until his untimely passing in 1997, only at the age of 37.Hutchence possessed a natural baritone, and his 'sexy' lower register crooning was part of his trademark sound. Michael's belty higher register was also strong, and he really improved as a singer between the albums 'Listen Like Thieves' and 'Kick' where he truly started showcasing the potential firepower his voice had. His passionate, swooning singing style and artistry are very respectable, and his singing style combined - over the years- the best bits of voices like Jim Morrison and Nick Cave while still staying very original and true to its roots. May Michael's legacy live on for the future generations.

His upper range is nasally but memorable and his lower extension is very strong, a major component to the band's harmony stack. Though most of his output tends to be regular and somewhat nondescript compared to his bandmates, he's occasionally pulled off some surprising vocal moments, like on the song "All I Want To Do" from their 1969 album 20/20:Around 1:23 sounds like a leap from A4 to falsetto A5. Crazy, and far as I know, repeated nowhere else in the band's discography.

Deep, Deep Down (Live in Amsterdam)Known for his multi-octave range and never-ending versatility, Mike Patton has established himself as one of the finest vocalists in modern rock. With his baritone, his effortless low range grants him an easy access to the lower reaches of the human voice. Even then, his great high note technique allows him to sing and scream up there with various approaches, ranging from a classical sound to the hysteric screeching.As a vocalist, Patton has influenced countless fine names, ranging from Serj Tankian and Brandon Boyd to Daniel Gildenlöw and The White Swan.

Many of these notes are a bit buried in the harmonies, so maybe I should re-check some of them to see if they're her or Helen... Sorry for the silly pic btw, if you find a better one you're free to suggest (or reject mine and substitute your own if you're an admin/moderator).
