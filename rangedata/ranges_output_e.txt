Though she occasionally sings some rather nice lows, those are mostly used to create dense harmonies, but not sung in the lead vocals. Most of her singing is extremely light and situated in the upper fourth/lower fifth octave area, with "In For the Kill", for example, being mostly sung on E♭5s. At the same time, her vocals are usually very solid and well-controlled. Interestingly, one of La Roux's best known songs, "Bulletproof", contains singing that sounds pretty different from virtually everything else she's recorded, with verses of strong, slightly twangy B♭4s. She has never replicated that tone live as far as I know, though.

The voice, warm and light, can be seen as weak, due to an initially seeming limited range, but the strength is found in the harmonies. Although, she tends to display her voice within the fourth octave, her voice doesn't particularly weaken in the fifth octave and surprisingly reaches the bottom of the third octave and retains its strength, hinting at further use of lower registers. Her tessitura isn't clear as it appears that her range may extend in both directions........................................................*Orange marks notes with questionable registers: absolutely no use figuring out these.*Purple marks notes in backing vocals.

His high notes were often very strained and raspy live, but his studio recordings featured some very clean and relaxed higher notes. His timbre was that of a bright baritone, which, combined with his rather high tessitura, made singing the tenor parts easy for him. His speaking was quite low. For this, he is best described as a 'baritenor', a voice that possesses both significant baritone and tenor qualities.He was one of my favourite members of KISS. Honestly, I prefer his version of "Beth" to Criss'.

A very interesting voice: very deep and powerful, sometimes he sounds like a mix of Peter Hammil and Matt Barlow. Surprisingly enough, his low range is not as wide as I thought , but still sometimes he can sound like a LB (And some of his lows sound demonic!!! Side note: they're a christian band ) . He guested on Ayreon's "The Human Equation" as the character "Reason".

In 2005 they released the album Flamingo Trigger, which featured Eric's impressive and expressive vocal instrument with nothing held back; shouting; yelling; screaming; that sort; it was very experimental in terms of post-hardcore.  2008's album, Introducing, brought a more alternative feel, with Eric Nally doing more than shouting: learning to sing to the limits of his quirky tenor.  After that came Foxy's self-titled album in 2010, which features very impressive pop singing from Eric - although still harsher and more rock than pop.  Finally, in 2012, we have The Church of Rock and Roll, a fantastic display of Eric's ever-improving voice.  His voice soars on extremely high notes, now much higher sung than the likes of Introducing, and he has more control over it, and can affect his tone better to go from clear highs to a grittier more textured sound.

Makes use of a distinct scratchy head voice technique for his higher singing giving way to comparisons to Robert Plant, yet possesses the boomy, weighty lower register of a baritone. He can reach the upper fourth octave fairly easily and can sustain in the lower fifth well enough, however as he has aged he has displayed more use of his mid to lower range.Examples of singing:Some effortless fourth octave notes and some well sustained C♯5s in the chorus, including a looooonnnggg one near the end w/ some help from reverb.Great contrast between his lower and higher registers, the latter coming in during an odd Donovan interpolation.One of my personal favourite metal songs, featuring some more C♯5s and some bassy lower vocals in the doomy bridge.A good example of his more recent efforts, displaying some of his best lower singing........................................................*Grey marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise obscured/muffled in the mix.*Italics mark non-sung notes.
