Very strong and versatile singer who often sang in a raspy, bluesy style, but also had the ability to sing in a cleaner style very well. He's showcased a very extensive high range, and more impressively, had great control over his high notes with the ability to use different approaches and achieve different sounds in his high register. He's also shown the ability to achieve a light tone as well as a deep tone and reminds me of both David Coverdale and Joe Lynn Turner at times. His voice has also aged remarkably well with his tone sounding as good as ever today at 60 years old and though he hasn't typically sung as high since the mid 90's, he can still get up there when he wants. While he's shown a potential for a pretty solid 2nd octave, he's rarely sung down there, but increasingly showcased some solid singing in the lower to mid 3rd octave, often with a deep tone as his career went on.

Here's a breakdown:2003: Everything's great--no vocal problems, has complete control over his voice, range is intact--still sings clean live. The last show with Paul's prime voice is Fresno 2003--he'd never sound that good again.2004: The warning signs of trouble: His timbre is starting to roughen up and he isn't singing clean 100% of the time. He still sounds like he's still in control of his voice (he can still do vocal embellishments), and his range still is intact. His voice basically has a slight "overworked" or "tired-out" edge to it.2005: Almost nothing from this year. This likely gives Paul a much-needed rest that does him good for the following two years.2006: His voice sounds stronger on the Japanese concerts from July. Paul then embarks on his Live To Win solo tour in October (the dates aren't as bad as Kiss tours). The Live To Win Tour of 2006-2007 is the last major Kiss-related tour (not counting the short Hit and Run Tour) where we hear Paul with his "classic" voice (after this--his voice would never be the same again).2007: He still sounds fine on the Live To Win tour (although not as strong as the previous year). Kiss then does a "lost cities" tour called the "Hit and Run Tour" that consists of five shows (four in July and one in October). Paul still sounds good overall (his tone is still intact). This short tour is the last time Paul has his "classic" voice."2008: This is where his voice really starts to decline--the first signs of Paul's vocal problems really start to hamper his performances (possibly nodules). He starts to randomly break and crack throughout his registers (mostly on mixed voice notes). His tone is also getting increasingly strained.2009: He starts losing his vocal power (which leads to a thinner voice). His vocal control by this point is really getting messed up.2010: The beginning of his absolute worst era. Vocal control is fucked, breaks and cracks are in most performances, his tone is strained and has little of his former power.2011: Sounds bad on most performances (although he does sound better at the Kruise shows for some reason). He gets vocal surgery in October.Post surgery (November 2011-Present): Mixed bag. He sounded absolutely terrible at New Orleans--but most shows that I've heard have him sounding rough but "passable" overall. He generally sounds better than anything from 2010-2011. He has better control of his voice (about the same as 2008), but his tone still sounds thin and strained.

They were formerly known as the Iveys until about 1970 when they released "Magic Christian Music" as Badfinger. Pete himself passed away in 1975, and is a member of the 27 club. Much of his unreleased work is available through posthumously released solo albums, such as 7 Park Avenue and Golders Green. He's an interesting subject due to him never singing in the 2nd octave.This is one of my favorite songs by Badfinger. Pete shows off 3rd to 4th octave singing up to B4 and some light falsetto singing in it.Pete speaks with an interviewer for the first 50 seconds or so if this video..For those wondering what he sounds like, the first 50 seconds is an interview. These are pretty rare since he was only "famous" for a few years......................................*Italics mark non-sung notes.

Armed with a raw, powerful belting style, akin to Cornell's modern style (and also looking like the lovechild of Cornell and Jeff Scott Soto), and a very dark timbre, Parkkonen stood out as a unique singer among the more forgettable names.Most of his music consists of quite generic, Audioslave-influenced rock, but there are a couple of gems:The chorus sounds very Cornell-influenced.

While singing along with the Jimi Hendrix-like baritone of Terry Kath, Cetera was always pushing his voice up to the higher harmonies without much effort, and sang tenor high Cs on various songs during Chicago's varying career. A rare feature of his singing is that he rarely opens his mouth wide while singing, and the reason's this:TFP: Is that a true story about how you came to have that clenched-jaw singing style? You, a Chicago Cubs fan, were at a game in Los Angeles in 1969 and got into a fight?Cetera: Yeah, let’s just say some Marines didn’t like my long hair and we got into a little beef, and I had a broken jaw and I was wired shut for a few months. And when they cut the wires off, I was always afraid of my jaw sticking open again, so I don’t really open my mouth a lot when I sing.I like Chicago's early music a lot, but sadly the quality of their recordings drastically decreased as the time went by. Cetera's solo albums I can't stand.Great vocals from their best song.

Born 7 November 1943 in JamaicaPeter Straker is best know for his long-standing professional and personal relationship with Freddie Mercury.As a solo artist he recorded four studio albums, one of which was produced by Freddie Mercury together with Queen's long time producer Roy Thomas Baker.In addition to his studio work he has been a member of the original London cast of "Hair" and other musical and theater productions.His versatile Low Tenor voice is characterised by distinctive vibrato-use and agile falsetto extension.Furthermore he delivers his songs with unique phrasing and operatic or theatrical tinge.In his music he combines a blend rock and pop with clever, often ambiguous lyrics.Voice type: TenorSung range: F2-C7Total range: D2-C7Significant high notes:C7 ("Hey Jude" live 2012)B5 ("Nasty", "Small Talk")B♭5 ("Nasty", "Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain")A5 ("Heart Be Still", "Nasty", "Real Natural Man", "Small Talk", "Star Circus")G♯5 ("Nasty", "Real Natural Man")G5 ("Black Swan", "Mountain High" live 2012, "Sweet, Sweet Music")F♯5 ("Heart Be Still", "Nasty", "Real Natural Man", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "The Boys Are Back In Town")F5 ("Believer", "Heart Be Still", "Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain", "The Day The Talkies Came")E5 ("Alabama Song", "Candle In The Wind" live, "Tear Down The Walls")E♭5 ("Tear Down The Walls")D5 ("Alabama Song", "Cock Robin", "Doesn't Give A Damn", "Heart Be Still", "Hey Jude" live 2012, "Mary's Boy Child" live, "Mountain High" live 2012, "Nasty", "Real Natural Man", "Tear Down The Walls")C♯5 ("Divided", "Mary's Boy Child" live, "Legs", "Nasty", "Rock A Bye Dixie" The Garden Lodge Improvisations, "Tear Down The Walls")C5 ("Divided", "It Ain't Easy", "The Three Bells" live 2013, "Vamp", "Willow")B4 ("Black Swan", "Dew Song", "Jackie", "Late Night Taxi Dancer", "Legs", "Mary's Boy Child" live, "Mountain High" live 2012, "Ragtime Piano Joe", "The Boys Are Back In Town", "The Day The Talkies Came", "The Spirit Is Willing", "The Three Bells" live 2013, "They've Got You Dancing", "Vamp")B♭4 ("A Bad Night", "Ada", "Believer", "Heart Be Still", "I'm Still Here" live 2010, "It Ain't Easy", "Jackie", "Ragtime Piano Joe", "Real Natural Man", "Rock A Bye Dixie" The Garden Lodge Improvisations, "The Boys Are Back In Town", "They've Got You Dancing")A4 ("A Bad Night", "Annual Penguin Show", "Before I've Even Said A Word", "Cock Robin", "Divided", "Home From the Night", "Jackie", "Legs", "Mary's Boy Child" live, "Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain", "Real Natural Man", "Rock A Bye Dixie" The Garden Lodge Improvisations, "Star Circus", "Tear Down The Walls", "The Boys Are Back In Town", "The Day The Talkies Came", "The Spirit Is Willing", "Vamp")G♯4 ("Ada", "Believer", "Candle In The Wind" live, "Doesn't Give A Damn", "Illusions Confusions", "I'm Still Here" live 2010, "It Ain't Easy", "Jackie", "Late Night Taxi Dancer", "Mrs. Warren", "Star Circus", "The Boys Are Back In Town")G4 ("Before I've Even Said A Word", "Believer", "Ragtime Piano Joe", "Rock A Bye Dixie" The Garden Lodge Improvisations, "The Spirit Is Willing", "Vamp")Significant low notes:D2 ("Black Swan")E2 ("Black Swan")F2 ("Talk About Me")F♯2 ("Mrs. Warren", "Talk About Me", "Tear Down The Walls")G2 ("Annual Penguin Show", "Dew Song", "Nasty", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "Vamp")G♯2 ("A Bad Night", "Dew Song", "Melancholy", "Mrs. Warren", "Ragtime Piano Joe", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "They've Got You Dancing", "Vamp")A2 ("Before I've Even Said A Word", "It Ain't Easy", "Nasty", "Small Talk", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "They've Got You Dancing", "Vamp")B♭2 ("A Bad Night", "Annual Penguin Show", "Nasty", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "Talk About Me")B2 ("Alabama Song", "Before I've Even Said A Word", "Ragtime Piano Joe", "Talk About Me", "Tear Down The Walls")C3 ("Alabama Song", "Annual Penguin Show", "Before I've Even Said A Word", "Black Swan", "Evensong", "Illusions Confusions", "Jackie", "Melancholy", "Mrs. Warren", "Willow")C♯3 ("Alabama Song", "Evensong", "Ragtime Piano Joe", "Sweet, Sweet Music", "What Is There More To Say", "When Love Was Hard To Come By")D3 ("Jackie", "Mary's Boy Child" live).......................................................*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.PERFORMANCES:(in chronological order)1972 - Cock Robin:http://picosong.com/3ACfThis song combines clever lyrics with some operatic high notes.1977 - Heart Be Still:Freddie Mercury providing backing vocals made this song one of the very few from his discography to have gained some minor popularity.Incredible falsetto runs characterise the vocals.1978 - Tear Down the Walls:http://picosong.com/3SXx/Powerful performance with some of his strongest vocal moments including an mind-blowing climax.1978 - Sweet, Sweet Music:http://picosong.com/3AcmPeter demonstrates his warm-sounding lower register on this tune.1980 - Melancholy:http://picosong.com/3ACrA simple, beautifully sung ballad.1980 - Real Natural Man:http://picosong.com/3APWThis uptempo rocker driven by Straker's powerful singing finishes his last solo record........................................................(The sound quality of most of his recordings is terrible. All available versions, including an official CD release of his 1980 solo album, are sourced from LP and quite terribly so.)
