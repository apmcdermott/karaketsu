With his natural voice revolving around the same area as Robert Plant's, Noddy sung effortlessly up there and even spoke tenor high Cs without any effort. Unsurprisingly, as a rock tenor, Noddy often avoided lows, only showcasing them on few of Slade's less popular tracks. Quiet Riot's powerhouse vocalist Kevin DuBrow owes a lot to this guy.My favourite vocals by Holder I've heard so far... He channels his inner Little Richard here.
