Zack has probably made some of the most aggressive and frightening vocals ever recorded, the sheer anger in his voice really fits the music of Rage Against the Machine. His voice is naturally very light, and you can hear him going very high easily while casually rapping with his aggressive trademark style."Beautiful World" has some surprisingly beautiful singing by Zack, he sounds a bit like Robert Plant on it.

She has a rich but relatively agile voice, which she never forces to travel much outside her tessitura. .......................................................*Orange marks notes with questionable registers: absolutely no use figuring out these.*Blue marks probable non-modal notes.*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.Some examples of her singing: Those belted D5s are like earthquakes. Light singing up to gorgeous B4s here, including a sustained one at the end. The video is so fitting. Also pretty light singing, especially compared to the other singer.  Natural, relaxed singing up to many high Cs and some falsetto Es, sounds great. A cover with much deeper, warmer tone (song starts at 0:22).

Copies David's current higher approach quite well too, with similar rasp and all.

Varla's got a unique voice with some wonderful darkness and dramatic quality to it, yet a tenor-like range and clarity. These traits make his voice sound very powerful and big, and he is able to keep his flexibility up there.I wish he had more of his performances on Youtube. Here's his defining moment as a singer:In my opinion, the greatest Judas of all time along with Carl A.
