In the harmony stacks, his parts were usually above Mike's but below Al and Brian's, while his lead vocals went all over the place. His tone was very sweet and resonant, but also had a darker color to it, and he lended himself well not just to the band's romantic pop songs, but also to their rocking and soulful numbers, particularly on the Wild Honey album:

Though able to put on some very convincing baritone rasp and weight, his natural voice is very light and naturally high-placed which shows often. With his ease and control up there, he is often singing melodies in the 5th octave without much problems. He also employs this very unique falsetto scatting technique very often...This is INCREDIBLE. Though his Nirvana-cover was a stinker, Casey performed some of the best performances ever in the history of American Idol.

His vocal placement and tessitura are similar to the likes of Daniel Gildenlöw, Serj Tankian and Elvis', all typical examples of agile, often bright, baritone voices (often described as 'high baritones' by many), although it has to be pointed out that these singers all obviously possess different-sounding instruments and styles. Although his higher register has taken a lot of beating since the beginning of his career, Chris has preserved his voice very well, and still sounds incredible, especially in acoustic settings, where his voice has picked up some additional clarity since dropping the excessive usage of his signature rasp. He remains one of my favourite singers of all time, and has also done some very creative work with his voice, using various techniques and effects to enhance his sound and improve the context of the song. Chris' lower register becomes apparent while listening to certain lower-key numbers and live gigs. "The Keeper" is a great example of Chris' rich, bright baritone. I'm definitely expecting him to use it more in the future, as it's a less explored area of his voice that sounds just as phenomenal as the rest. Singing low-key numbers is much harder in a super-loud environment (as with Soundgarden), but his upcoming solo material definitely has room for further exploration of his amazing instrument!As a singer, Chris belongs among those many names who have easily busted the myth of "only tenors being able to sing high notes". His influence on rock singing is very apparent, and there are various singers copying his approach. Apparently, he trained his voice the risky way by simply screaming his ass off back in the day, until his voice didn't break anymore. With that said, the secret behind the sound of his amazing vocal style is - obviously also his unique, unimitable voice, but also - volume control (Chris' singing is actually not too loud, but the microphone hides this), with vocal distortion and vibrato applied to give the singing a 'louder', more powerful effect. An exceptional talent! I will keep on researching his voice as much as possible, because his singing really intrigues me.- Thread by Timi

(Actually, they're E♭5's)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gcik1ZMTDv86:30 for E♭6.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFObU6-qN_kMight be something lower third octave in verses.

Crazy non-modal note at 1:25.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmV3pXm5juUYou can hear D5's starting from 4:23, followed by C5's.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnABRPS37hkC♯5's at 0:50, for example(repeated several times throughout).http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fgb5ATrZocAE♭2 is somehwere in the 2:45-2:59 range. E♭5 is, i'm pretty sure, during the chorus in the background vocals.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF9ZhUnNXxw3:42-4:17, most likely where the F♯2 is.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1eAdCEvdv42:28 on, these verses contain C5's. Reaches up there(or B4) in the chorus too I think.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLetxYab9hEFrom 3:48 on the C♯5's can be heard on the line "FOREVER you will..."http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJJ27NxYamYHad to get a note in from here, harmonized D5 in the pre-chorus at 3:00. I think he hits C5 in the pre-choruses as well, very nice singing here.(I have a version that I mixed using the multitracks from Rock Band where the backing vocals are mixed more prominently, and it is a D5)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXCsR6tBE-QC♯5 at 3:28, the whole section there I think has a few B4's/C5's too.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRYhWFBHpkMC5's at 0:46 and on.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jIBTmdGKKQD5's at 2:00-2:12.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya2JgAWPqHgD5's from 3:58 on.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LynitCiYJ9g4:49 for a sustained C5.

He is also able to add some great rasp to his voice, resulting in more baritonish delivery.

She has (in my opinion) a great and pleasant voice to listen to, along with a decent range. She has great belted notes in the lower fifth octave, while also possessing a strong, dark lower range. She only goes out of her comfort zone on a few occasions, meaning you won't hear a lot of extreme notes from her.I listed her as a contralto, because of her strong low range and her trouble singing above E5. Though I understand if you think she's a mezzo.
