Heavy In Your Arms2. Cosmic Love3. Shake It Out4. Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)5. Bedroom Hymns6. Lover To Lover7. Dog Days Are Over8. Spectrum9. You've Got The Love10. BlindingAmazing singer and musician.Though she usually uses her trademark dark and chesty (but clean) belting in the upper fourth and lower fifth octave, some of her high notes (for example the F5s in the harmonies of "Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)") are more "heady" and ethereal. In some songs, like "Dog Days Are Over" and "Never Let Me Go", she also sings fifth octave notes smoothly in the melody. Her falsetto notes are usually very balanced and clean, however the sixth octave notes in "Blinding" and various radio and live performances are very shrill and piercing. The lows are rather scarce but pretty nice........................................................*Blue marks probable non-modal notes.*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

There's a lot of lower singing and smooth falsetto to be found on his songs, especially in the background vocals.
