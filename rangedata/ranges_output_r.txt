Really light and pretty nasal (without being unbearable) chest tone, and the few highs he's got sound very nice. I feel like I've missed something since their harmonies are often very complex, so feel free to suggest any missing notes.

Teenage PacifierThough approaching his singing with a Hetfield-like technique (hell, he even looks a bit like Hetfield), Gyllenhammar's natural timbre is almost identical to Ian Astbury's voice, just lighter. He has that baritone-like texture to his voice, but his rough singing style had me fooled for a long time about the natural placement of his voice - he definitely spots much easier time singing high with clarity and power as opposed to his whispery and uncomfortable lower register. He also spots a VERY impressive vibrato, which he is able to apply to even the roughest of textures.1:50 - Ian Astbury and Ralf must be long-lost brothers or something...

A very dramatic tenor, he is able to climb up to great heights with ease and sing above tenor high C effortlessly with a bright ring, yet also possesses a REALLY deep vocal tone akin to a baritone that makes him sound quite unlike of your typical tenor. He is able to seamlessly control and blend his multi-octave range. Although not possessing the same higher register as back in the day, Rance remains a very strong live singer, and his singing screams emotion and soul.

The early WZ albums and EPs feature him doing some bizarre, atonal howls, screams, and barks, including a brief period where he was able to hit fairly clean fifth octave notes (1987-1989), while they aren't the most quality high notes you'll hear, they still have a good enough resonance and support (from what I remember) to the point where I wouldn't consider any of them "red". Ironically, he didn't start to show any use of low notes until the early 90s on "La Sexorcisto" but he still kept them mostly to layered background vocals. It wasn't until the band started experimenting w/ lower tunings around the time of "Astro-Creep" that he truly started to show the strength of his low range and has steadily improved that part of his range since, note the fairly casual E2s on "Spookshow Baby"........................................................*Grey marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise muffled/obscured in the mix.*Brown marks highly distorted notes.*Green marks "YEAH!!" notes*Blue marks disconnected falsetto notes.*Navy marks prominent vocal fry notes*Italics mark non-sung notes
