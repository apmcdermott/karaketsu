He has very easy highs, and still has a great voice today. It's hard to pick a standout performance, given he is really consistent!Has done work with Threshold, Ayreon, Star One, Headspace, Maiden uniteD and has his own solo projects. There's a lot of content I still have to go through, but most of his Threshold and Star One content has been watched........................................................*Orange marks notes with questionable registers: absolutely no use figuring out these.*Blue marks probable non-modal notes.*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

While his approach to singing may sound unconventional for Power or Folk Metal, his mid tenor alt rock-ish timbre is pretty pleasant (his voice reminds me of Gerard Way at points). He has some realy easy C5s, but hardly go higher than that and his lower singing is quite pleasant, even there's few examples of him going second octave.Examples of him singing:Spoiler:

Through a long career with such influential bands as Edge of Sanity and Nightingale he has become a prolific producer, multi-instrumentalist, and general legendary name in metal. .......................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise obscured in the song mix.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

Notes sound lower than what they are. Sounds a bit ill actually.1988: Less dark voice. Quite high. 1990: Voice sounds great. Lots of power and great emotion in voice. Some overdrive singing as well. Live sounds very thin and annoying though.1992: Dark 3rd octave notes appear. Symphony of Destruction. Generally like 1990 but a bit less power.1994-5: Extremely powerful voice and can do melodic singing instead of just yelling. Sounds like he is pushing it. Lots of overdrive on vox. Live sounds almost like studio.1997: Voice sounds a bit like 1992 again.1999: Voice has deepened. Strong upper 2nd octave notes are present. Live voice sounds very warm and less tinny.2001: Lower range is more present. High notes are getting a bit strained. Live vocals sound like he is not breathing while singing.2004: Voice sounds chunky and quite growly at times however upper 4th octave notes sound a bit weak and shaky. Live vocals are very tinny but sound above average.2007: Very resonant. Warm voice. Notes of up to B4 have a great sound. Also very good dark low singing and live voice is excellent.2008: Live voice sounds shaky and upper 4th octaves suffer from Mickey Mouse issues.2009: Very powerful and "manly" voice. Can hit excellent Ab4's. Voice sounds very tired though (adds to brutality). Live most highish notes are even lighter than 2008 and frequently.2010: Anything in 4th octave is Mickey Moused. Even low notes sound broken live.2011: Got voice back for a while. Voice sounds brutal on album but sounds like it is shot.2012: Got a bit of his voice back. D tuning live. Managed to hit some horrible but non Mickey Mouse A4's2013: Voice on SC sounds tired but a bit better than 13. Live lots of improvement. Hits strong F2's live and manages very clean G4's. Can hit A4's as well. And no sign of Mickey!

Pretty light and effeminate timbre (especially on those sappy ballads) ala Michael Sweet (even looks a bit like him!), altho he's able to grit it up for a more Sebastian Bach sort of sound (just compare his performance on "In My Garden" to any Skid Row ballad), naturally, he has his pretty effortless highs and some strong lows in at least the lower third octave. They pulled a 180 with their second and ultimately last album "Inwire", bandwagoning onto the whole "alternative" thing (even their bassist admitted they "sold out") with mediocre results, unfortunately leaving them w/o much of an identity as the years go by.Examples of singing:The premier Sven Gali song, showing off his effortless highs (w/ a sustained C♯5 going up to a sustained F♯5 @ 2:42!   ) and grittier sound.Another one with a similar approach, B4s throughout and some notes even higher later on (altho his choice of wardrobe is questionable).An example of Sven Gali's "alternative" sound (and one of the few good songs off that album), featuring some strong lows and more effortless highs.P.S. Sorry about the odd pic but it's the best one I could find from back in "the day" that I didn't have to crop out of a whole band pic-------------------------------------------Grey marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise muffled obscured in the mix.Italics mark non-sung notes.

Personally, I think he never got to show his full potential as a vocalist, due to his death.

His voice was very light up until the mid 80s when the latter band dissolved (almost nearing baritenor). Since then, his timbre has gotten gradually huskier and raspier due the usage of smoking and "other" substances, while still maintaining a strong and effortless tone in the upper fourth octave, while relying almost exclusively on raspy non-modal screams to reach the fifth octave. (note: I suck at pitching those kind of notes so pitches on most blue notes are approx.)Examples of singing:.......................................................*Blue marks soft or disconnected falsetto notes.*Green marks highly distorted notes*Grey marks notes in backing vocals.*Navy marks prominent vocal fry notes*Italics mark non-sung notes..

An amazing singer with a very good technique as well. Would love to hear him use his warm, dark lower range more as well.

Stylistically he is very much rooted in the blues and soul tradition, with a signature rasp and intense high notes. Often compared to Robert Plant, he differs in that he has a natural baritone voice, as opposed to Plant's effortless soaring tenor. While he rarely exploits his warm lower sound, he still has a very solid low register when he does use it.

I remember her having a G#2 somewhere, it was discussed by Ray and Celice IIRC and it was a quick slide just like the second-octave notes in "Maria". I'm not sure about the lows in "I Know But I Don't Know": they do kind of sound like her, but their guitarist Frank Infante is credited for co-lead vocals on that track...

Her "Got Dynamite" E5 is one of my favorite notes of all time   , just something about the way she finishes after it, and the build-up... Anyway, I want to hear any possible criticsm's of the notes registers(and fullness   ) and maybe, if anybody else gives a shit about Demi Lovato like I do, people can post additional findings? I thought I was smart for finding notes by her until I ran into a video that had every single one I notewatched... but I can still notewatch some more too.
