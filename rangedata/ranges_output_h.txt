She sings down to the D3-A2 area all the time and her natural timbre is probably about unparalleled as far as depth and resonance in that area goes, and at the same time she has some very nicely powerful and smooth belted notes up to about A4, and comfortable, ethereal highs up to the mid-fifth octave in many songs. All through her range she maintains perfect vibrato and all-round control. I also think the way she combines the different sides of her voice is rather elegant, too.Spoiler: Might be the most delicate singing I've hear her do, the song is absolutely beautiful, too. Good showcase of her two tones at their best, excellently sustained and vibrato'd B2s and B4s. Surprisingly catchy song with lots of range showcased. Weird song with tremendous lows, but then again that's what most of her songs are.

Harry "The Tyrant" Conklin is known as the powerhouse lead singer for such classic (yet underappreciated) metal bands as Jag Panzer, Satan's Host, and Titan Force. He's most known for his strong, powerful belted highs in the B4-D5 area, as well as his piercing Halford esque screams above that. He has some of the most over the top vocal performances in terms of metal style high notes I've heard. Despite having an underused lower register, he is also known for his smooth and at times operatic approach to the lower 3rd and upper 2nd octave.He's also 51 and still one of the top metal singers out there!EXAMPLES:.......................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals.*Italics mark non-melodic notes.

Because of the fact he's so obscure, few of his songs are available online, but you can listen to those that are by following these links:http://www.myspace.com/heathkingmusichttp://www.myspace.com/flowsite/music/songsStylistically, his approach varied. In his solo material it was quite soulful and reminiscent of Jeff Buckley, but in his material with Flow it varied between that soulful style and a more crazy one a la Mike Patton. Heavy use of vibrato is almost always present in his singing, and can be heard on most his songs. Heath used falsetto in a large portion of his discography, but was also able to go high with grit and power, as shown at the end of "Say My Name"(solo), "Click Over"(Flow) and others. King also was able to darken his highs, which can be heard in the song "Desert"(Solo). He also displayed the ability to throat sing and hit impressive modal lows, with the song "Gung Ho"(Flow) being the best example of both.(He's singing in all of this video)R.I.P.

Hope has a warm, cooing voice that may at times be sultry and other times cold and distant. She may be a mezzo-soprano, but never steps out of her comfort zone. Quite a beautiful comfort zone, though, even if she never explores her upper registers.

Huey strains almost all his highs and he also seems to sing all his significant high notes constantly and maybe multiple times in the same song. He strains his A4s yet he sings them all the time. I couldn't really find any significant low notes of his he seems to stay in the upper 3rd and 4th octave but he can most definitely go lower. I'm open to criticism I just really wanted a thread to be made of him. It most likely needs work.
