Fronting Queensrÿche for 30 years (before being fired earlier this year), his vocal contribution on songs such as "Queen of the Reich" and "Take Hold of the Flame" still influences metal singers around the world. While he doesn't showcase his bright head-voice as often anymore, he'll still occasionally bring out a surprising high note from time to time. His later work with Queensÿche shows a gradual change of focus to his mid-range, where he sounds more comfortable these days. His voice has certainly lowered since the days of "The Warning" over the past decade or so. Recently, his vocal and performing skills have appeared to be a lot weaker - in addition to his egoistic attitude and legal problems with the rest of his ex-band members - which is a huge shame, considering that during his prime Tate ranked among the best of the best in metal.

Graham possesses a dark, dramatic baritone vocal timbre combined with a tenor-like range. During his earlier days, he'd sing like a full-blown tenor with ring, brightness and clarity, but throughout the years, his voice has evolved very strangely, ending up with the baritone-like sound. Due to his extreme tenor range singing combined with his modern deep timbre, the word 'baritenor' describes his voice perfectly.

He's widely known as one of the iconic helium tenors of the 60's and 70's, with his studio debut in 1963. I'm sure you all would've hoped for a massive range, but I think it's important to remember how incredibly-well Nash sang with the range he had. While some singers have painful-sounding, gritty and difficult-to-pitch screams, my friend here has bright, clear notes all over the board. Granted, you'll find he sang a bit differently with CSNY, but their music is a lot easier to listen to. He's also well-respected because of how he blends his registers together. In other words, you may have difficulty distinguishing his head vois or falsetto at times from the rest of his range. If you want to hear some tasteful Hollies-Nash, refer to: Maker, King Midas in Reverse, Stop Right There, On a Carousel, etc. Regardless, he's a textbook example of a tenor, so at least we don't have to argue about that. Apparently he still has an impressive range. They mess with the keys of CSN songs a lot lately, though.Now let's hear him sing!singing: Marrakesh Express showcases his 3rd octave singing, considering his distinct lack in 2nd octave notes. His B2's early in his career were quite thin, as we hear in an earlier song 'Clown' (visible in the spoiler at the bottom of this post).But wait. You want to hear some high notes, don't you? I'm sure you can't resist.clicky:More Crosby, Stills and Nash; Start listening at 1:38.Harmonies up to C5 in this gem. Sustained B♭4's, as well.Oh, but you want his clear, helium D5's from the Hollies? Fine, fine.helium: Allan actually sings the song, but Graham sustains several D5's (hear one at :34) that Paul McCartney originally believed to be an instrument........................................................*Italics mark non-sung notes.*Green marks the occasional disconnected rough-sounding screams that are worthy of mentioning.Nash:
