He rarely pushes his voice beyond the general comfort zone of his voice. I love his mid-range singing on "Stayin' Alive", sounds a bit like George Michael.1:50

He also had a moderately successful solo career in the 1970s and 1980s but shot to fame again in 1987 when he duetted with Jennifer Warnes on the hit single "I've Had the Time of My Life" from the film Dirty Dancing.Areas still to check:I don't think I've gone through all that much of his solo stuff.Notes unsure about:The E♭2 in his solo version of "You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling". Not sure exactly what pitch it is. Its not a particularly good sounding note so maybe it should be coloured red.Other comments:From what I've listened to it seems that Bill Medley tended to stay in his comfort zone especially when singing as part of the Righteous Brothers. Both the lowest and highest notes that I have listed for him are from his later solo works and even here I don't think he is singing at the extremities of his range. As a result I'm pretty sure his range is bigger than what I have stated but the question is if he ever sang higher or lower.

Bob Catley has been the underrated singer of English pomp/AOR rockers Magnum since their formation in 1972, and has also released a string of high quality solo albums that take on a more metal influenced approach. He loves belting notes in the A4-C5 area and in general has a very pleasant higher tone. He's quite a tasteful singer and while lower 3rd octave notes and upper 4th/lower 5th octave notes are common, he much more rarely goes above or below that. He's also well known for his work with Avantasia and Ayreon.To this day at the age of 66, he continues to tour worldwide and sound great with age only playing a slight factor in his sound. .......................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise muffled/obscured in the song mix.*Italics mark non-melodic notes.

He is underrated and brilliant! The voice is used effectively in a croon in the 2nd octave and he soars his way with ease as upper 4th octave notes are sustained in a full, bright chest register, sometimes attaining 5th octave notes. The head register/falsetto is smooth and warm, never hoarse.
