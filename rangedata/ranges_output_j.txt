Though getting rather screamy and thin around his top range, Christian is able to sing high melodies very well like a true tenor, with agility and power - a classic example of a 'baritenor'. Along with the strong high range, he possesses a rather warm lower range.

Of Wolf and Man (S&M)Spoiler:Kewis wrote:My timeline for Hetfield's voice:1983: Very screamy voice. Lots of false-chordish screams on Kill 'Em All. Technically speaking they're not very good, though his vocals sound cool. He is pretty terrible live though.1984: Less false chord, stronger singing. Notes over A4 are pretty uncontroled though. He's also shown to be able to sing more melodically like on "Fade To Black". His voice is bland though.1986: Voice is less screamy now. Singing on Master Of Puppets is more controlled. Voice is pretty light live, I'd say it's even lighter than '83-'85.1988: Voice has deepened, and darkened. And Justice For All and The Revisited Garage Days EP or whatever actually feature my favorite timbre of his.1989: Very powerful, dark voice. Sounds like he is really pushing it live.1991: The Black Album showcases some of his never heard before low range (except for a strained B2 in some RTL song), and his singing is much more melodic. Solid, clean controlled notes up to around A4 on album. Voice is much more baritonish.1992: His voice is starting to lose power, and the way he's pushing it is not helping.1996: He now sounds like an average baritone. The albums Load, Reload and Garage Inc showcase great lower singing, and strong higher singing. His belting is usually very chesty. Lots of tracks spread around 2 octaves. He usually struggles with the high notes live though.2003: Voice sounds very tired on St Anger, though suprisingly his voice live is pretty powerful.2008: Good singing on Death Magnetic, but live his voice doesn't have a lot of power, and he usually stays in a monotone range.2013: His voice has gained alot of power. Hits controlled notes up to around E♭5 in a lot of performances. He seems to have learned a headier technique. Has some minimal problems with phrasing, but all around his live voice is good.

His higher range starting from around A4 is remarkable a beautiful warm chest tone or at times, mixed voice. His ease in the lower 5th octave must also be applauded.

Pepper John Lennon look like Barry White.  He is well known for his Beatle-esque tenor voice and often times sounds a HELL of a lot like George Harrison.  One thing that particularly draws me to his music his profound ability to layer his own voice to create wonderfully structured harmony.  You often hear this ability in songs like "Turn to Stone", "Sweet Talkin' Woman", and "Don't Bring Me Down."     As the lead songwriter and producer of Electric Light Orchestra he is needless to say an extremely talented musician.  As a singer, he is just as talented.  His ability for singing clear and light Beatles-esque tenor has given him more than enough means to create an array of wonderful music.  I am actually proud to have made this thread. The video I have linked here showcases his tenor singing. Here is another fantastic example of his singing.  At this point in the process of this thread I would like to say I could call him a high baritone.  It's really weird to hear him sing because he really does have many different styles.  I think this whole album "Discovery" in a whole is sung rather heavier I suppose.  I think back to "Time" where he is gliding on all the fourth octave with ease.Top Albums Featuring Jeff Lynne1.  Out of the Blue2.

Prior to the formation of Nitro, Gillette also released a solo album with Batio on guitar in 1987, and he later formed a groove metal band called Organ Donor releasing one album in 2001. His last project was his collaboration on ex-wife Lita Ford's 2009 album Wicked Wonderland. Gillette's most notable trait as a singer is his powerful head voice which gives him a seemingly endless high range. He showed remarkable control with his head voice sustaining upper 5th octave notes for over 30 seconds and did a good job eliminating breaks and blending it with the rest of his range as shown in the first clip below. His mixed voice has more of a head tone, and real chesty sounding notes are rare as his tone tends to be thin. Despite the high notes, he's a natural baritone with a deep voice and some surprisingly strong lows throughout the second octave, though his low range can also get growly.Vocal Scale edited into Machine Gunn Eddie - Clip made by Ray.Freight Train D6Shot Heard 'Round the World C6Proud to Be Loud B5Thanks to Sandblasted for help with a lot of the lows.

Joe's credits include albums with Rainbow, Deep Purple, and Yngwie Malmsteen. For a large part of his career, Joe sang as a bright yet heavy tenor, eventually developing a raspier and "harder" style of singing. He likes to push mixed voice to the limit, but take to higher pitches in a clean head voice. He is very gifted, and very consistent.

A raspy, smokey tenor akin to Steven Tyler and Sammy Hagar, makes good use of his gritty high range while adding false chord distortion occasionally, contrasted with a dark low register uncharacteristic of most tenors, albeit scarcely used.Examples of singing:Good example of Crabby's earlier vox, featuring a well sustained C♯5 towards the end.Dark lows throughout the verses and pre-chorus, some easy singing around C5 as the song escalates, w/ some good D5s and E♭5s as well.Arguably Corabi's signature performance w/ the Crue, with a gritty sustained F5 towards the fadeout.One of my favourite performances of his, some great gritty high singing and harmonies w/Glenn Hughes.Another standout performance, featuring crazy imitations of Mick Mars' solos going all the way up to G5!.......................................................*Grey marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise muffled/obscured in the mix*Blue marks soft or disconnected falsetto notes.*Green marks highly distorted notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

Though in later days he sounded like a bass when speaking, he sounded way higher in early singing performances... Though he's singing in a weird raspy head voice for some of his highs. I'm gonna check if I can find more singing by him...Btw I'm listing the Eb5 as "total range" because I think he unintentionally reaches Eb5s while intentionally singing D5s in that live cover.

I didn't bother to try pitching any of his speaking yet, but he definitely got some very easy lower 2nd octave notes... Definitely a voice that'd be described as a 'baritone' nowadays, as opposed to his more tenor range-heavy singing of the earlier years.

John West 
John West-Vocal summary: Clean, effortless highs; powerful, versatile mid-range; somewhat light (though infrequent) lows.Associated with: Artension (1996-2004), Royal Hunt (1999-2006), Ten Man Push (2007-present).Genre(s): Progressive metal, hard-rock.-Examples of singing:Spoiler:"Ivory Towers" (Cozy Powell; Especially For You; 1998) - Soulful, powerful passage showing highs topping out at the lower-fifth octave. Some of the top notes here also display the raspier style he often opted for earlier in his career."The Way" (Artension; Machine; 2000) - A multi-layered clip displaying sustained highs peaking at C5, as well as his effortless fourth-octave notes."Revolutionary" (John West; Permanent Mark; 1998) - A crazy sustained A5. West's flawless, consistent execution of notes like these makes him quite a gifted vocalist.-Description:Spoiler:John West has done vocals with Artension, Royal Hunt, Ten Man Push, and others. He has an awesome high register which he executes effortlessly throughout many songs.He has employed many vocal styles throughout his career. From raspy, powerful highs like in "Smoke and Fire" and "Let it Ride", to the smoother notes in tracks like "Stand, Sentinel", West has displayed consistent energy and power within his vocal work.From about 2003, he began to also use to a lighter vocal style which makes his later work often sound significantly different.His more recent contributions include vocals for Mistheria (2011) and Artlantica (2013).-Detailed note list:Spoiler:High notes:C6 ("Mind Journey", "Smoke and Fire")B5 ("Through the Gate")B♭5 ("Run to the Hills”, "Blood Brother", "Lost Memory")A5 ("Smoke and Fire", "Long Gone", "Pariah”, "High Speed Life",  "One Way", "Phoenix Rising", "Mind Journey", "Revolutionary", "Forces of Nature", "Visitors", "Why Does Love Hurt", "Side By Side")G♯5 ("Man With a Mission", "Stormbringer", "Eastern Horizon", "World Wide War", "Lies", "Voices", "The Burning Times", "Sacred Pathways", "Area 51", "Total Recall", "Power in the Wrong Hands", "Intervention")G5 ("The Burning Times", "Ship of Dreams", "Stand, Sentinel", "Stand and Fight" (Artension), "You", "Freedom Reigns", "Blood Brother", "Smoke and Fire", "Madness Calling", "Fight for the Light", "Demon in my Mind", "Heresy", "Dark Before the Dawn", "Poison Ivy")F♯5 ("Mind Journey", "Why Does Love Hurt", "Hands in the Fire", "Into the Eye of the Storm", "Dragon's Eye", "Mother Earth", "Heresy", "Life", "Machine", "Total Recall", "Running Out of Time", "Close to the Sun", "Sleep of the Dead")F5 ("Blood Brother”, "The City is Lost”, "Smoke and Fire", "Destiny", "Guardian of the Hunt", "Call of the Wild", "Asia", "Devout", "Side By Side", "Across the Seven Seas", "You're Still Away", "Fight for the Light", "The Last Battle", "The Emperor", "Tall Ships", "Sailing on a Stormy Sea", "The Killing", "Bringers of Rain")E5 ("Mystic Wings”, "High Speed Life”, "History's the Future”, "Into the Eye of the Storm”, "Area 51”, "Valley of the Kings”, "Into the Blue”, "The City is Lost”, "Evolution in Reverse”, "Time Goes Slowly By”, "Rule the World”, "Third Wish”, "Masquerade”, "Power in the Wrong Hands", "Destiny", "Ride Like the Wind", "Revolutionary", "Iron Horses", "Victim of the Plan", "Another World", "Long Gone", "The Power Within", "Far Away" live, "Earth Maker", "Hearts are Broken", "Story Teller", "Poison Ivy")E♭5 ("Eastern Horizon”, "Run to the Hills", "Sleep of the Dead”, "Fear”, "Lies”, "Cold City Lights”, "Total Recall”, "World of Illusion”, "The Key”, "Let it Ride”, "Area 51”, "Goin' Home”, "Behind Your Eyes”, "Guardian of the Hunt”, "Ivory Towers”, "Make You a Man”, "Regeneration”, "Power in the Wrong Hands”, "Epilogue" (live), "Responsible", "Tall Ships", "The Key”, "Mother Earth")D5 ("Doin' The Natural Thing", "Dragon's Eye", "High Time to Fly", "History's the Future", "I See Through Your Eyes", "Running out of Time", "Song of the Desert", "Stand, Sentinel", "The One that Got Away")Low notes:E2 ("Federation")F2 ("Clean Sweep", "The Emperor", "Nightmare")G2 ("You", "Man With a Mission", "Over My Head")G♯2 ("Fear", "Kiss of Faith", "The Mission" (live), "Sevdah Metal Rhapsody", "Total Recall”, "Edge of the World")A2 ("Fair Trade", "Flower of the Orient", "The Wind and the Rain", "Set Me Free", "Endless Pain", "Calm Before the Storm")B2 ("Tree of Knowledge", "Third Wish", "Valley of the Kings")C3 ("Guardian of the Hunt", "Slipping Away", "Fade", "I Don't Want This Night To End", "Take Me In Your Arms", "You Are My Heart (Ode to Autumn)").......................................................*Italics mark notes not considered as "sung" - notes that are spoken or yelped, for example.-Further listening:Spoiler:

While at the beginning of the band's career he had a somewhat more warm tone, with less focus on his high notes, as they have gone on his tone has become brighter and his higher range has strengthened significantly (for instance, compare the somewhat uncomfortable A4 in "Life and Love and Why" from 1997 to the A4s in "The Sound" from 2011).

A classically-trained singer, José is known for his expressive bright tenor voice, his powerful, metallic and really frequent high notes (most of Mägo songs feature singing with highs at least as high as C5), his signature usage of vibrato and folk-influenced vocal melodies. He also showcased an elegant and warm style of softer singing that suited MdO's ballads perfectly. Highly regarded as one of the most important singers on the Spanish Rock/Metal scene, José's powerful voice was a very important ingredient to the Mägo de Oz sound, as he helped to build the band massive success on its mother country.Around 2006/2007, due to intense touring, aging and other factors (alcohol, tobacco), José's voice gained a much rougher sound (he was noticeably struggling with notes higher than A4, a really big constrast with his "earlier voice", used to hit D5s and E5s with so little effort), his high notes possessing a less brighter tone. He left MdO in 2011 and started his (bland and uninteresting IMO) Hard Rock/Blues Rock solo project called José Andrëa y Uróboros, where his rougher approach is still used frequently, but he slowly started to show signs of recovery.- thread by Shikkaku

Judika is one of the best male solo singers in Indonesia. With him, a song with any color can be sung perfectly. High vocal range is his trademark. Judika's vocal will entice anyone either in both the recording and on stage performances. The Youtube user MimiXtinaChelleKRow called him 'The Indonesian Adam Lambert', with the C5-E5 area being his strongest suit.In 2010 Judika released his sophomore album entitled Setengah Mati Merindu. This album spawned multi genre songs from ballad to rock. To date, his single Aku Yang Tersakiti has been #1 on RBT chart for 4 consecutive months.
