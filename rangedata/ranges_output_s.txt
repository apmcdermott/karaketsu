His lows are impressively strong, but his natural voice placement is that of a typical low tenor. Joe Elliott would probably be a good example of a singer with naturally a similar voice to Le Bon's, just rangier.

Sinéad started her career as a mezzo, with a remarcably lightened technique for high notes, but it sounds like she's an alto nowadays (though she still hits E5s and such). Though obviously she's most famous for "Nothing Compares 2 U", a lot of her music is really beautiful, and I think her new album How About I Be Me (And You Be You) might well be one of her best (she also sounds great on it).

Insane high notes, but not a lot of lows. It's a shame he's so under-recognized; the guy deserves way more fame than he has. I can't actually remember where his C2 was, but I just remember that it was in some growly laugh...so if any fans of this guy's music know anything by him in the ways of that, feel free to post it here.
