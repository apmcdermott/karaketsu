Neeley's portrayal of Jesus has received a lot of praise and acclaim through the years from fans and critics alike, especially because of all the power and emotional intensity displayed.One of Neeley's biggest strengths remains his upper range. Naturally a baritone, Neeley possesses a country singer-like timbre, not to mention an amazing vocal range of 4 octaves. He uses a seamlessly blended heavy metal falsetto (extremely similar to Ian Gillan's) around the upper parts of his voice, which merges into the rest of his range and allows him to effortlessly wail up there like a banshee. An exceptional talent! > Ted Neeley's vocal range video

Johnson has had his share of projects, working as a live vocalist for Apocalyptica, for example. His most famous stint was probably with The Leningrad Cowboys, for whom he sang for a while.Johnson has this rough but light voice, best described as a 'baritenor'. His voice sounds a bit thinner than it used to do, though he can still put on some rasp. Some of his 5th octave studio high notes are rather peculiar, but overall his highs sound awesome. Case in point, this quite unique cover right here:

Had a fairly light voice and some nice highs back during the '90s, but since Tito & Tarantula's second album, he's started to make a much more prominent use of his low range instead. Seems like his highs are few and far-stretched nowadays.

He has great head voice control and that "prog metal" diction one would associate with singers such as Nils K. Rue and Geoff Tate, but with a certain sound of his own as well. I look forward to hearing more singing from him on future albums, as he has also shown hints of a rather strong lower register........................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals.*Italics mark non-melodic notes.

The Voice. You name it! Even after various centuries of singing, Tom's still going strong with his huge, powerful instrument.Although his voice has gotten deeper since the early days, Tom's always spotted a wonderfully flexible high baritone rather similar to Elvis' in terms of vocal placement and tessitura. In the days of his vocal prime (60's-70's), Jones was able to sing quasi-tenor extremely convincingly with his 4 octave range and a unique baritone sound. His remarkable control and range soon led to massive acclaim, and he remains a very respected singer in the business for his soulful and powerful delivery. Now, with his voice even deeper than previously, his lower register has almost a bass-like dark quality to it, giving Jones' singing amazing additional character.

He has a decent range and a very nice timbre on his clean vocals (his harsh vocals are pretty good too). Sometimes he has a very awkward vibrato especially on the high end of his range. Some examples of his singing (both clean and harsh) Notice the vibrato at his higher notes around 2:50 :Pand his lovely clean singing around 4:05.This is what we call musical bipolarism. The screams and growls are pretty wicked and his cleans are sure lovely.I notewatched all BTBAM albums, so the work is pretty much done. He can growl pretty deep but I haven't bothered with it

Though a tad lighter and more nasally, Salmela owns an extremely similar approach to Hietala's, which allows them to harmonize really well, blending their voices into one. The Hietala-like strong vibrato is also present, and so are the extremely well controlled high notes.I'd rank this as Salmela's best vocal performance.

Sukekiyo that have released only one song so far). Without a doubt, one of the most talented and versatile vocalists active. While DeG was already making music since 1997 and Kyo had already experimented with different timbres and textures, it was only recently (around 2007, with the album "The Marrow of a Bone") that Kyo really started to explore the full potential of his voice - something he keeps doing at full strength .From brutal death growls to subtle feather-light falsetto, to crooning to deranged screaming, to opera to powerful fifth octave belting, Kyo extreme vocalizations often cost him hospitalizations (DeG had to cancel dates more than once because of his health).    Kyo's live performances are extremely inconsistent, as his voice has shown both signs of deterioration and recovery a lot of times on his career. Considering the extreme stress he puts his voice through, he often have trouble replicating his vocals on live settings. Of course he has demonstrated extremely tasteful and well-done live performances, but sometimes, even in short periods of time like one day after, he would fail at performing the same song. Recently (2012) he started to take more care of his voice, scheduling less gigs for allowing larger periods of rest, having healthy food and exercise habits and quit smoking and alcohol.-Thread material by Jever
