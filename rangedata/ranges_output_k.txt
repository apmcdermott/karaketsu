Her belting is powerful although she typically restrains herself to do her trademark, surprisingly strong, yelps and screeches. Her exclamations show great potential at the use of her upper head register/falsetto. Another great surprise is her sudden use of vocal fry in some performances/songs.

Cool stuff.Also, if you find a good-quality photograph where she doesn't look like a pretentious asshole let me know  .......................................................*Orange marks notes with questionable registers: absolutely no use figuring out these.*Blue marks probable non-modal notes.*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

Ironically, his lows are fairly quiet on the album but he projects them much better live. I personally think of him as a cross between Chris Robinson of the Black Crowes and Paul Rodgers. He unfortunately faded into obscurity after leaving the band in 1994, last I heard he had taken up playing drums for some local Raleigh bands.He's only sung on one full album to my knowledge ("Brother") so unless some more live material or some other misc. stuff pops up I consider this finished.Examples of singing:Piss easy belted B4s all over the place w/ some trills up to D5 later on from COL's most popular song.2:41 - Some bent and sustained E5s, incredible control!  A live version that DESTROYS the studio version, Kelly sustains the C♯5s and improvs some well projected lows after sliding down from them!Showing off more of his mellower side w/again some better projected lows than the studio version.His best performance IMO, some mellow bluesy verses contrasted w/some powerful higher singing later on.-------------------------*Grey marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise obscured/muffled in the mix.*Italics mark non-sung notes.

Kirka had a very unique voice with lots of power to it. His voice started degrading during the 90's, though, probably because of intense touring and demanding songs. It is a shame he didn't record more English songs, apart from the extremely cheesy Finnish metal albums. His pronunciation was Tony Kakko-like (aka. quite hilarious and typically Finnish), but he still nailed all the songs he attempted. Earlier during his career, he sang as a ragged tenor-like singer, attempting heavy metal as well, but he spent the later days of his career singing with a prominently deeper and raspier baritone. For this, his voice is well described as a 'baritenor', a voice that includes considerable qualities from both a baritone and a tenor.

Sukekiyo that have released only one song so far). Without a doubt, one of the most talented and versatile vocalists active. While DeG was already making music since 1997 and Kyo had already experimented with different timbres and textures, it was only recently (around 2007, with the album "The Marrow of a Bone") that Kyo really started to explore the full potential of his voice - something he keeps doing at full strength .From brutal death growls to subtle feather-light falsetto, to crooning to deranged screaming, to opera to powerful fifth octave belting, Kyo extreme vocalizations often cost him hospitalizations (DeG had to cancel dates more than once because of his health).    Kyo's live performances are extremely inconsistent, as his voice has shown both signs of deterioration and recovery a lot of times on his career. Considering the extreme stress he puts his voice through, he often have trouble replicating his vocals on live settings. Of course he has demonstrated extremely tasteful and well-done live performances, but sometimes, even in short periods of time like one day after, he would fail at performing the same song. Recently (2012) he started to take more care of his voice, scheduling less gigs for allowing larger periods of rest, having healthy food and exercise habits and quit smoking and alcohol.-Thread material by Jever
