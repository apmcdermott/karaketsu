("The Rite").......................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals.*Italics marks non-sung notes.Ms. Gerrard is a splendid human with a splendid voice. Her voice in her lower registers rivals one of a baritone at times. The mid-chest register has a large sound and is smooth and silky. ("The Lotus Eaters") The lower register is booming and controlled with amazing precision. ("Gloridean") The belting area is bright and operatic with an androgynous heaviness. ("Sanvean: I Am Your Shadow") The head register is both a sweet, operatic sound with many fundamentals of a mezzo-soprano ("Cantara"), and a warm, breathy voice with a velvet-like quality. ("Come Tenderness") Often uses drawn out phrases while using syllabic styles of vocalization, namely melisma. ("Yulunga [Spirit Dance]")SONGS MENTIONED ABOVE:

Sweet tone, high placed voice. Im most of the songs with Theatre of Tragedy from their first two albums she sung mostly with A4s  (with occasionally 5th octave notes). She shows her low register mostly with her solo work.Examples:I know we shouldn't talk about voice types anymore, but... you think she's a mezzo or a soprano? I used here this video, again, would be great if someone check the notes: And I used this "draw" of thread made by samuelhinchliffe01 : http://therangeplace.forummotions.com/t116p540-threadless-singers?highlight=liv+kristine#8100If someone know more notes - write!
