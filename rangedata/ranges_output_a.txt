Personally, I believe that all the years of harsh screams and raspy singing have taken their toll on his voice and changed the natural sound to what it is now, damaging his cleaner singing and lower register, resulting in the baritone-like rasp in his voice. The traces of damage become very apparent while he tries to sing lower: he is able to project weak B2s akin to Dave Grohl or Jacoby Shaddix's lower singing, but he has to push a lot to project out very whispery A2s, and sometimes barely succeeds at that. You can also hear this while he speaks: he struggles to speak below C3 and the speaking voice has a very evident rasp to it all around his range.Even with the previously said points, his traits can be seen as a positive thing, that contribute to his vocal power. Gontier is a great, consistent singer who handes his own stuff well. The baritonish sound adds some great characteristic to his voice.Some great, restrained singing by the man here; you can hear him struggle greatly with the A2s, but other than that, he nails the anthem.Though obviously not quite as good as the original, Gontier sings this well. Performances like this create the illusion of him being a baritone, thanks to the husky, dramatic delivery.

He played a leading role in introducing rock music to Russia, and has also performed in opera. His huge voice is well adapted to singing with orchestras, rock bands,  just his guitar or even a capella.  Wikipedia says he has a three and a half octave range, which we've discovered is actually an underestimate.He shows off some amazing control from 3:40 onwards here:Not a bad pair of lungs for a smoker.

When singing like this he shouts hard and fast while maintaining great tone and control. Andrew Vanwyngarden is most famous for being the main songwriter for MGMT.  I actually just started listening to them about a year ago and the stuff he writes with them is just amazing.  I am particularly impressed with the harmonies he works out and the way he puts his voice to them.  Also, I know this looks as though it's lacking notes but I literally went through their entire discography song for song and listened to each song all the way through.  You might be able to find five more notes at best, but; this is all the significant stuff I could find.  Since he only is featured on five or so albums, I just posted one album that I think demonstrates his best vocals. The video I posted is a demo song that is not on any of his albums. I think it's great, it features those "rock n roll" vocals I was talking about.  The first fifteen seconds is some electro pop craziness but just wait till the real vocals kick in.

Annie does all sorts of tricky stuff with her voice, from varying a lot her tone by adding varying degrees of air (the high singing in "No More "I Love You"'s" represents) to belting at pitches she could probably hit relaxedly. She also varies her technique quite a bit, from the complex, almost operatic falsetto highs in "There Must Be An Angel" (where she even does a descending scale from A5 to C3!) to the rough, even throaty singing in "I Need A Man". I still have to notewatch more stuff, but I guess this is already complete enough for "Range Stuff".

Anoji can be considered as a female-counterpart of Kyo: she has a never-ending versatility that both scare and amaze people with her voice. Well, she can sing crystal-clear powerful high notes in a japanese folk singing style, scream hysterically, use death grunts, giggle, whistle scream, and do some pretty low notes as well. But, unlike Kyo, she is ugly and she can sound extremely irritating, but her bizarre vocalisms match Gonin-ish music (that can be compared to a musical version of a Japanese Gore Porn movie.)PS: I don't have a clue of whose blues and oranges are the correct ones, so screw that.Some Rice Ball Massacre: PS: Non-safe for ears stuff above.They have an actually-decent song called "Tsuki to Hangyoujin" but I can't find it on Youtube . The Clean singing on "Jinbaika" is really great, but the song is ruined by her screams.

Once in a while he actually displays surprisingly strong and deep lows, and his voice seems to have lowered and worn out far more than Paul's, probably due to the smoking........................................................*Purple marks non-lead vocal notes.*Blue marks probable non-modal notes.*Red marks extremely bad, unimpressive or unintentional notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.
