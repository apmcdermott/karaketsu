As au vocalist he began with a raspy bark developing into a harsh shriek around Under the Sign of the Black Mark (considered one of the first black metal albums) until deciding to focus on clean singing on the 1990 album Hammerheart. At first he had a very nasal sound but around the Blood on Ice album he developed something of a "noble" sounding voice with strong lows and an improved fourth octave. He also released two solo albums that were more in an alternative rock and folk influenced style........................................................*Purple marks notes in backing vocals or otherwise muffled/obscured in the song mix.*Green marks harsh/distorted notes.*Italics mark non-sung notes.
